# NoSQL Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice NoSQL Languages

## Projects
### Project 1: Basic CRUD Operations
**Overview**: Create a simple application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a single collection in a NoSQL database.

**Skills Focus**:
- Basic understanding of NoSQL concepts (Document-based or Key-Value stores)
- Setting up a local NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase)
- Using a NoSQL database client or shell
- Implementing basic data manipulation operations (insert, find, update, delete)

### Project 2: Data Modeling
**Overview**: Design a schema for a basic application. Consider denormalization, embedded documents, and references.

**Skills Focus**:
- Understanding data modeling principles in NoSQL
- Document-oriented design
- Handling relationships between documents
- Optimizing for query performance

### Project 3: User Authentication with NoSQL
**Overview**: Build a user authentication system using a NoSQL database to store user credentials securely.

**Skills Focus**:
- Hashing and salting passwords
- User registration and login processes
- Managing user sessions
- Security best practices for NoSQL databases

### Project 4: RESTful API with NoSQL
**Overview**: Develop a RESTful API using a NoSQL database to serve and store data.

**Skills Focus**:
- Building HTTP endpoints for CRUD operations
- Handling request/response data in JSON format
- Implementing authentication and authorization middleware
- Error handling and validation

### Project 5: Real-time Data Processing
**Overview**: Create a system that processes real-time data streams and stores them in a NoSQL database.

**Skills Focus**:
- Working with streaming data sources (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Processing and transforming data in real-time
- Ensuring data consistency and durability
- Scalability considerations for real-time systems

### Project 6: Geospatial Data Management
**Overview**: Build a location-based application that utilizes geospatial features of a NoSQL database.

**Skills Focus**:
- Storing and querying geospatial data
- Implementing location-based searches and calculations
- Indexing geospatial data for performance
- Integrating with mapping libraries or services

### Project 7: Full-text Search
**Overview**: Implement a full-text search functionality using a NoSQL database.

**Skills Focus**:
- Understanding full-text search concepts
- Indexing text fields for efficient searching
- Querying and ranking search results
- Handling complex search queries and filters

### Project 8: Distributed NoSQL Database
**Overview**: Set up a distributed NoSQL database cluster for scalability and fault tolerance.

**Skills Focus**:
- Configuring replication and sharding
- Handling node failures and data consistency
- Monitoring and scaling the database cluster
- Understanding CAP theorem and trade-offs

### Project 9: Data Migration and ETL
**Overview**: Develop a data migration and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using a NoSQL database.

**Skills Focus**:
- Extracting data from various sources (e.g., CSV, SQL databases)
- Transforming and cleansing data
- Loading data into a NoSQL database efficiently
- Handling schema evolution and versioning

### Project 10: Performance Optimization
**Overview**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in an existing NoSQL application.

**Skills Focus**:
- Profiling and benchmarking the application
- Analyzing database query performance
- Indexing strategies for improving query speed
- Caching and query optimization techniques
